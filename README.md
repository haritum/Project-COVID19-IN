# miniProject-WebScraping-Covid19-INDIA
This repository has been created to keep track of files created as a part of **[Project to automatically pull COVID19 data from mohfw.gov.in](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/)**.

- Ministry of Health and Foreign Welfare (mohfw) hasn't created an API for COVID19 as of now.
- This small python script is used to pull the up-to-date Covid19 scenario in India (from mohfw.gov.in) and save the data as **stateCOVID19_yyyymmdd.json** file.
- We limit ourself to access state-wide COVID19 information about:

1. Serial number of the State/UT
2. State/UT Name
2. Total no. of confirmed cases
3. Total Cured/Discharged/Migrated cases
4. Total Deaths
